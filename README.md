## What I Do

I operate at the intersection of engineering and business, transforming product vision into resilient platforms that enable companies to grow with confidence.

Experienced in owning systems end-to-end — from early architecture decisions to high-scale production environments.

I focus on building infrastructure that reduces operational friction, accelerates teams, and remains dependable under pressure.

> Build platforms that scale with the company — not against it.
