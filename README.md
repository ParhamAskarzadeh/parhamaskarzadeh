# Parham Askarzadeh

**Engineering platforms that enable companies to scale — technically and operationally.**

I build production platforms from zero to scale — engineered for reliability and aligned with real business needs.

## What I Do

I operate at the intersection of engineering, platform architecture, and business strategy — transforming complex product vision into resilient systems companies can confidently grow on.

Experienced in owning platforms end-to-end, from foundational architecture to high-scale production environments.

> Build platforms that scale with the company — not against it.
